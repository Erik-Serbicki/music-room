# Music Controller Web App Tutorial - From Tech With Tim

My notes based on Tech with Tim's awesome tutorial series and GitHub repo. I use functional components for react instead of class based, but everything else is essentially the same as the original. Here, I outline all the steps I followed, down to the most basic and detailed instructions. I used Python version 3.10.6, and my system is Windows 10. My IDE is VSCode.

I reccommend DO NOT READ THIS, and go watch the series on YouTube instead. The main difference is in the react specific portions, I use functional components instead of class based ones. For rest of the project, I believe Tim's explanation to be much better than mine. That being said, if you would like to just read it here, I will try to explain what I do, and if I do anything different than Tim, I will be sure to explain why.

I also tried to keep all the names the same as in the video, so if you are watching the video and looking here for some specific stuff, hopefully there are no problems with different names. 

One more thing: at the end of Tim's tutorial series, he has a video explaining how to transfer the class based components to functional ones, so if you prefer video format for learning, please watch his video.

This web app is a music room, where a host a can create a room and play music, and guests can join and control the playback.

*A note on "I" vs "We": like I said, most of this is just Tim's tutorial series. I felt it would be confusing to write "Tim did this" for everything, so I stuck with a generic 'we' to represent me, Tim, and hopefully you too. For parts where I differed from the tutorial I tried to use "I" so it is a bit less confusing, but I am sure I mixed it around at some parts.

*Why are you reading this when you could be watching the tutorial? Go do that.
